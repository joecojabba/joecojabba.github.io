<p>The problem:  The state of dynamically generated content is not maintained through the browser history.</p>
<p>The example in my case was that we had a form that contained elements that were programatically added.<br />
The user would make some changes and submit the form and continue on to the next screen.<br />
If the user hit the back button, the state of those dynamic elements reverted to their initial values.</p>
